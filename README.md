*Under Development*

There is now only very simple feature - 
- getting as input a windows dirlist generated by `dir /a:-l` command
- parsing it and storing inside a sqlite database
- rendering using Flask and showing to the user inside a HTML table

TODO -
- Select a better way to store the parsed information, sqlite is too heavy 
- Some analyzing of the dirlist information. Maybe some diff recognition between diffrent versions ? 
- Search functionality (over the database, not over already rendered information)
